# Web_Scraper

I have done this project as a side work during my bachelor studies. My intention in doing this project is to refresh my Python syntax knowledge, learn the basics of HTML, BeautifulSoup library for web scraping, and use of database.

This program extracts information from a real estate agent website and put it into a table to make analyzing data easier and faster.

What it basically does is;
- Expects user to perform a specific search at the website with all desired filters etc,
- User copy-paste the resulting link to the program's entry bar,
- Program crawls through in each page of search to extract related information,
- Creates a table accordingly and can save it to any desired data file (csv, json, db, etc.)
